What Did I Learn?

1. Props and states, passing on props and states to child components in react
2. handleGeneral = (e) => {
   this.setState({
   [e.target.name]: e.target.value,
   });
   };
   Created single function to handle the multiple inputs in a component.
3. Adjusted functions and state to allow multiple education/experience.

What did I struggle with?

1. I've used react before but it's been a while so took time to learn everything again.
2. Too much recycling even using react. Probably ways I could have shortened code or placed functions in their respective components. Shoved too many things into APP file.
